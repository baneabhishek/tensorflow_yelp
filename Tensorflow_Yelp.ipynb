              "        b\"i violated my rule of avoiding grocery shopping while hungry and decided to venture over to whole foods.  whole foods tends to be the indecisive individual's nightmare (that would be me).  yet, this store is a foodie's dream. \\\\n\\\\nthere are aisles upon aisles of glorious, wholesome products (pun intended).  everything is meticulously organized and there are at least ten varieties of every type of item.  no joke.  it took me fifteen minutes to decide which brand of bottled tea would be suitable (and economical). \\\\n\\\\ni roamed the freshly prepared food section like a vulture circling it's prey...strategizing which choice would be the best taste sensation.  did i want a made-to-order wrap?  or a glass of wine and a couple tapas? (the live music was alluring)...maybe sushi?  pizza?  salad bar?  soup? maybe something from the smokehouse...oooh! a cupcake from the cupcake bar? \\\\n\\\\non and on it went. \\\\n\\\\nmy final decision was sushi. the spicy tuna roll tasted fresh, and the pacific salad roll was very crisp. i also grabbed a container of ginger for $1.99--not the artificially preserved pink variety--all-natural pickled ginger.  bliss.  i purchased some cucumber salad from the salad bar as a side/palate cleanser. all in all, a very satisfying meal. \\\\n\\\\nprices are a tad higher than your average grocery store. then again, it is whole foods. a word of advise:  come with a game plan (e.g. a shopping list). if you don't define what it is you want prior to entering this store, you'll end up spending two hours and twice as much money than you anticipated.\",\n",
